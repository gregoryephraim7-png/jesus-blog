   <h1>JESUs is love</h1>
   <div class="two-columns-container">
       <div class="left-column">
           <p>Jesus doesn’t just show love, He is love in motion. His love is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>unconditional (John 3:16)</li>
    <li>sacrificial (John 15:13)</li>
    <li>eternal (Jeremiah 31:3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Loving people is not occasional for Him—it’s constant. He healed out of love, rebuked out of love, died out of love, and still calls us by love.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Love as Lifestyle</p>
<p>If love were a hobby, Jesus practices it daily—without fatigue, without limit, without hesitation.</p>
