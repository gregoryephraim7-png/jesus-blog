  <h1>Amazing hobbies about Jesus</h1>  
  <p class="intro">When we talk about hobbies, we imagine something someone does passionately, consistently, and joyfully. If Jesus had what we could call “hobbies,” they wouldn’t be painting or hiking—they would be soul-changing expressions of His nature. These divine passions reveal not just what He does, but who He is.</p>
